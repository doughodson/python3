    "# Review of Historical Crash Recovery Mission Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "Hours ago a high-value UAV crashed in a remote region of California.  A recovery beacon on the UAV is active but no GPS information is provided by the beacon, and all that is known is the general region of the crash based on the last received transponder information before communication failure.  Search operations are underway.  Cloud cover in the region is dense, preventing overhead assets from joining the search.  There are currently multiple field teams taking signal strength data using low-altitude handheld UAVs and those reports should arrive soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mean time, leadership has asked for your help. Before you begin analyzing live data from the current UAV recovery mission, you will come up to speed by reviewing historical data from a previous search event which resulted in a successful recovery operation.  This historical data contains the GPS coordinates of both the search teams and the actual beacon location for each observation. Since the location of the downed asset was known, you can determine critical feature—**distance**—and calibrate your analysis tools in a controlled, error-free environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely observe that the relationship between signal strength and distance to beacon is not simple since in a mountainous area, terrain between a beacon and a sensor often blocks & attenuates signals, and sometimes a recording which is far away from the beacon, but at a high altitude, might have a stronger signal than a sensor which is closer but blocked by terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding Task Overview\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load** the historical mission dataset into a pandas DataFrame and **visualize** the locations on a map.\n",
    "2. **Create a function to Calculate** the distance (in meters) between each search team's reported location and the beacon using a geospatial library.\n",
    "3. **Include** this new distance feature as a column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "4. **Scatterplot** the relationship between distance and signal strength\n",
    "5. **Save** the augmented DataFrame to a new CSV file for use in later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This calibration step will help ensure your code and methods are accurate before you tackle the more complex, real-world data from the current mission."
